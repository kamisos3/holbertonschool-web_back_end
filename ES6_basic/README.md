# JavaScript ES6 - Basics

▶ **Introduction**

This project demonstrates the core features of ECMAScript 6 (ES6), the major update to JavaScript that introduced new syntax and capabilities for writing cleaner, more efficient, and more maintainable code. The code in this folder covers a variety of ES6 concepts such as block scoping, arrow functions, default parameters, rest and spread operators, string interpolation, object creation, and more. Each file is designed to showcase a specific ES6 feature, making it a practical reference for anyone learning modern JavaScript.

▶ **Overview**

This folder contains multiple JavaScript files, each focusing on a different ES6 feature. The code examples are simple, concise, and demonstrate how ES6 improves upon previous versions of JavaScript.

▶ **Concepts**

- Block-scoped variables (`let`, `const`)
- Arrow functions
- Default parameters
- Rest parameters
- Spread operator
- String interpolation; embeding variables within the string
- Object and array destructuring
- Enhanced object literals
- Loops (`for...of`, `for...in`)
- Creating and manipulating objects
- ES6 modules and imports

▶ **Example**

ES6 function using the spread operator:

```javascript
export default function concatArrays(array1, array2, string) {
  return [...array1, ...array2, ...string];
}
```

This function demonstrates how the spread operator can be used to merge arrays and strings into a single array.
